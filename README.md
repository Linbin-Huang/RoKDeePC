-- MATLAB R2020b (or higher versions) is required to run the simulink models. 
   "OSQP" (https://osqp.org/) may need to be installed to run the models with DeePC.

-- To get the results, open the Simulink model "RoKDeePC_running.slx".
!! Then, simply run the script "Run_whole.m".
!! The results can be found in the colored scope of the Simulink model "RoKDeePC_running.slx".
   The other functions/scripts in the folders will be automatically executed during the simulations.

-- The example nonlinear unknown test system in the Simulink model corresponds to the one in Example 1 of the paper.
   The converter model in Example 2 contains some blocks whose copy rights are owned by MathWorks and is therefore not released at this point.
   We may release the converter model in future versions of this software, once we replace those blocks with our own code.
   Interested readers can try with their own models in the RoKDeePC simulation framework, while as mentioned in the paper,
   the kernel parameters may need to be re-chosen (in the file "InitFile.m").
   
-- The main parameters of RoKDeePC can be changed in the script "Load_parameters.m".
